#JavaScript Projects Collection

This repository contains three JavaScript projects:

1.Contiguous Subarray Sum
2.String Transformation Based on Length
3.Responsive Gallery

#Project 1: Contiguous Subarray Sum

Problem Statement

Given an array of integers and a target sum, determine if there exists a contiguous subarray
within the array that sums up to the target. Return true if such a subarray exists, otherwise 
return false.

#Example
.Input: arr = [4, 2, 7, 1, 9, 5], target = 17
.Result 'true'
.Explanation: The subarray [7, 1, 9] sums up to 17, which is equal to the target.

#Project 2: String Transformation Based on Length

#Problem Statement
Given a string, transform it based on the following rules:
.If the length of the string is divisible by 3, reverse the entire string.
.If the length of the string is divisible by 5, replace each character with its ASCII code.
.If the length of the string is divisible by both 3 and 15, perform both operations in the order 
 specified above.

#Project 3: Responsive Gallery

This is a simple responsive gallery using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The gallery displays a grid 
of animal images with their names and locations. It adjusts to different screen sizes, stacking images 
vertically on smaller screens.
#Features
